# What is Creativity?

“**I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free**”. This quote by Michael Angelo captures the duality of what it means to be creative \(King, 2020\).

Being a creative individual means thinking, exploring, understanding, discovering new ideas, and most importantly taking risks while ignoring doubts and facing fears. It means doing something for the sake of doing something totally different, the ability to think independently of anyone direction of thought to look for opportunities for knowledge and to manoeuvre one's inner cacophony and a riot of perceptions and neurological transmissions into a meaningful form of expression to which other people are able to relate.

It comes with experimentation and hurdles, such that there are possibilities of inspiration found even in the most mundane places with the capability of influencing your perspectives. Inspirations can at times be derived from places, ideas, things, and people alike. 

Thus, in one sense, creativity allows us to grow better, connect with other beings, and in one sense make the world a better place, where individuals can express their creativity, in order to achieve a deeper understanding of one’s purpose in life.

It’s often said, “**we create by perceiving, and ‘perception’ itself is an act of imagination, and an outcome of creativity**”. In the world out there, there is no benchmark set to conclude if someone is creative or not. Creativity means different things to different people depending on the 9 muses, niche, or medium of expression, because we interact with, process, and produce creativity differently. And likewise what might be creative for one person might not be for another. Thus, E.H Gombrich in the Story of art often puts forward the thought that there are no likes and dislikes in art but it is the object or subject in the frame of art that might be liked or disliked \(p. 16\). A set of notes played on a piano is ‘music’ to some ears while it’s noise to some. In other words, it can also be interpreted as quietness in chaos and chaos in quietness, which is the reason creativity of often denoted as being a ‘matter of perception’.

Steve Jobs once said,

> Creativity is just the ability to look at things in a new way. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.



Essentially creativity is about making connections and taking actions. Taking action is a really important factor for doing something creative as it drives new ideas, theories, and technologies from insights into reality. This is because if one has a bunch of ideas but doesn't act on them, that person is called imaginative and not creative.

It can also be said that the entire process of creating something is more important rather than just the final polished outcome, and most people struggle with this process, and questions often arise like if their work is good enough? Will they be able to salvage something from the train wreck they imagine they have created? Does the interaction with their work provoke something? \(Clear\). In one sense, thus it is said that the journey of creating art is more important than the art piece

In the current time, creativity is as perplexing as it was in the ancients, who cast creative ingeniousness in the realm of the supernatural and declare it the work of the muses. To understand the creative process, we can think of it as a four-step process as mentioned in the book “The Art of Thought” by the British psychologist Graham Wallis where he outlined the theory of the creative process based on many years of observing and studying the inventors and creatives. This creative process entails four essential steps:

* **Preparation**: The first step \(discover and listen\) the creative process, is to gather new information and materials, and acquire knowledge about anything and everything that one’s brain can handle around the project.
* **Incubation**: In this step \(design and create\), the information and ideas collected in step 1 are brought together to slowly create tiny, million connections in mind. During this process of growth of ideas, the thinker takes their focus off the problems and allows them to rest. Though their conscious mind is not thinking about it, the unconscious thought process is busy in creative thinking, something that Einstein called “Combinatory Play” which is an act of opening up one mental channel by dabbling in another.
* **Illumination**: In this step \(develop and implement\), following the period of incubation, insights began to arise from the deeper layers of the mind, and this is where the jolt in the consciousness awareness tells that you have got the idea. This sudden flash of the solution is known as illumination and is similar to a lot of our 11 “aha” \(Eureka feeling\) moments and it happens when we are least expecting it to happen.
* **Verification**: In this step \(deploy and deliver\), the ideas are refined. You know that you have the solution, but it becomes necessary to verify whether those solutions are correct or not and make minor changes as these solutions would be used to make the foundation structures of the project. If the results don't come to be true, the thinker goes back to the creative process from the beginning and gathers more resources and knowledge to find the missing elements

The process mentioned above doesn’t always move in a similar order, and it tends to look more like a spiral than a straight line. Another important factor that adds to the creative process is how thinkers inspire and thrill us with numerous possibilities. Creative thinkers are those who have the courage to do something different against all the odds. It then doesn’t matter how many people you inspire, one or one million, they have the ability to continue to learn and evolve \(Gregoire, 2019\).
