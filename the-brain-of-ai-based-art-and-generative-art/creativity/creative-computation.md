# Creative Computation

We discussed three types of creativity in the last section which have been modeled by computers and have contributed greatly to the aesthetic of computer art. Their performance would certainly be tagged as ‘creative’ if it were done by a human being. However, there is a likelihood of objection to tag the computer ‘creative’ as shall be explored through various parts of this study.

It’s not surprising that AI and computers can be creative when creativity is evaluated via ‘combinatorial creativity’ discussed above. After all, nothing could be simpler than to provide some simple commands along with images, improvising music notes, and let the machine combine it using some sort of randomness, eventually, most of the outcomes would be quite novel, surprising, and unfamiliar.

Computers are capable of doing creative things like making music and songs, writing stories (GPT-3), scientific reasoning, generate cooking recipes, draw and paint pictures, innovative ideas in literature and architecture, and other visual effects. This brings us to Computational Creativity which is a multidisciplinary endeavor that is located at the intersection of the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, philosophy, and the arts (Can Computers Be Programmed to Think Creatively? 2016).

Upon evaluation of Computational Creativity and the study of the so-called ‘brain’ of the computer, it can be very easily concluded that computers are more than feature tools and instead are more like autonomous creators and co-creators in their own right.

According to the Computational Creativity Conference Steering Committee (the group behind many computational creativity research events), the goal of computational creativity is to model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one or more of the following several ends: (Association for Computational Creativity, 2019)

* To construct a program or computer capable of human-level creativity •
* To better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans •
* To design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves

Computational Creativity is often applied to Artificial Intelligence, in order to produce innovative outcomes which are imagined as impossible for computers such as sculptures, written work of fiction and music, art pieces, pop art, etc.

While computers have been known for using complex algorithms, and mathematical logic, creativity once again is thought to be an exclusive domain of conscious beings. The question over the possibility of computational creativity and can machines be creative is quite popular and many creatives are vocally against it. The questions arise as “how should computational creativity be evaluated?”, or “can systems programmed by humans be considered as creative?”. Further evaluation of creativity and the philosophy of creativity are covered in the section [_"The ‘heart’ of AI based systems – Society, Human Interactions, Economics, Philosophy and Behavior"_](broken-reference)_._

In the computational field, when scientific research is performed, the evaluation of how efficient the results are and how well the scientific process was carried out is quintessential. Thus, some sort of system to evaluate against the process is important as a procedural testing method. However, in the case of creativity and the general fuzziness in the definition of the term, such an evaluation made by human beings tends to be subjective. Object A might seem to be creative to person B, while not creative for Person C. Therefore, to facilitate better evaluations, the Turing test and the Lovelace test offer a determinant if a machine is creative or not.
