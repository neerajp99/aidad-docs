# Tests of a machine's ability

### Turing Test

The Turing Test was a thought experiment that was used to determine whether or not a computer could fool a person into thinking that a computer was an actual human being, such that one cannot differentiate between a human and a computer when communicating with them. The test was crafted according to the following criteria- If the computer could imitate the human, then it should be considered ‘intelligent’. This was based on the party game at the time of the “Imitation Game”, where two people would go into separate rooms with typewriters and people would ask them questions through the doors and they would reply typing on the typewriters pretending to be the other person and the guest would figure out which person was which.

Alan Turing proposed that in the “Imitation Game”, a person should be replaced with a machine or Artificial Intelligence and then conduct the same experiment and see if the Artificial Intelligent could pass the test just like humans or not. In 1950, when Turing wrote his seminal paper on this topic, he was not proposing that this test should be used to determine whether a computer is intelligent or not. He was trying to convince people that it might be possible for computers to have a tendency to imitate human intelligence to help us understand how the brain works \(The Turing Test \(Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\), 2016\).

After the test was released, other arguments relevant to the topic came up such as The Chinese Room argument, which proved that Turing’s test is inadequate as it is more a matter of appearance vs. reality. Searle’s put the argument forward that the computer only appears to be intelligent but in reality, it is false intelligence, which Searle defines as simply “simulating the behavior” \(The Chinese Room Argument \(Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\), 2020\). 17 The above two criticisms reflect on the debate around AI and creativity. And could be said that Turing’s school of thought are supporters of AI and Searle’s school of thought are thought, provokers.

### Lovelace Test

Ada Lovelace, the first computer programmer said that “Computers can’t create anything. For creation requires, in the minimum requires originating something. But, computers can be said to have very minimal originality. “They merely do that which we order them, via programs, to do”. She was suggesting that a computer cannot have human-like intelligence till the time it’s only doing what we humans have programmed it to do. For a machine to be creative, a machine should be able to generate new original ideas \(O’Neill, 2014\).

This brings the idea of the Lovelace test in 2001, which is a thought experiment that specifies a machine to be intelligent if they are able to surpass the original ‘thought’ and its outcome, that can’t be differentiated by humans based on the original code. So, creativity became a proxy for intelligence and the researchers who developed the test proposed that Artificial Intelligence could be asked to produce something creative, like a piece of painting, a poem, music lyrics, and more, and the Lovelace Test would be passed only if the AI programmer could not explain how the machine came up with its answer
