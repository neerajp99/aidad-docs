# Can AI/Machines be creative?

When creating art and music, random mathematical functions can be used , or some extremely complex algorithms using chaotic functions, pseudo random numbers to generate random shapes and structures on a canvas \(cartesian plane\) or a sequence of music notes. Though most of these art and music produced would be something that is never seen before but a large part of it would be chaos and not so aesthetic in appearance. This is because computers are unable to differentiate what is beautiful for humans and what is not on their own.

But, if we look into the things around us, and model natural processes which allows creativity to form, our mind sort of experiences ‘The process of Evolution’, which mirrors the way we and animals alike establish a knowledge base on the basis of all what is around. As it is known we learn from experiences, events, education and interactions around. And then, we tend to reproduce, mutate, mimic and establish our own ‘thought process’.

Similarly, the Evolutionary algorithms or more commonly the genetic algorithms which mimics the Darwinian laws of nature via the Darwinian laws of natural selection. These biological evolution through the means of reproduction, mutation, recombination and selection, forms a parallel, exploratory search for solutions. This technology of mimicking the natural laws of nature is based on a population of solutions, rather than one single solution. These solutions are continuously refined over generations and generations and it can afford to try out novel ideas and discover solutions that are quite surprisingly creative

Evolutionary algorithms have made it possible to come upon new designs and behaviours through ebullient, but guided explorations. Another area of Artificial Intelligence entails Deep Learning which works with supervised training on existing datasets and takes advantage of 19 massive amounts of labelled data and computational power to develop statistical models through regress training processes. This has been well proven in the field of automating behaviours but when it comes to extending past them where Artificial Intelligence can think ‘out of the box’, evolutionary algorithms come into play advancing the creative approach of AI \(and machine creativity\), finding and working towards solutions which do not exist yet. For example, a few applications of evolutionary computation could include creating musical melodies, coming up with trading strategies for foreign exchange, gene network reconstruction by analysing microarray data, generating new design forms which are more complex and effective than human designs \(Miikkulainen, 2018\).
