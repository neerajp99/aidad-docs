# Generative/Music Intelligence

Generative music is any music where apart from the compositional process is delegated to an autonomous system of agents other than the composer, which is mostly a computer-composer interaction, in which the composer creates an algorithm, or in other words a set of instructions to carry out a specific part of the compositional process.

The first example of generative music was The Mozart’s Musical Dice Game (Musikalisches Wurfelspiel) which uses mathematical patterns and dice to compose music from precomposed options. Similarly, Golan Levin’s work involves the use of a stylus and computation to generate music where the program translates what you draw into musical compositions.

Brian Eno, one of the first generative music artists used real magnetic tapes, and created a sort of loop at the end to a random looping around so that every musical piece which is produced is unique just as the basic starting point. According to Brian Eno, generative music are systems which create “ever-changing music,” that could “produce original music forever,” lamenting the limitations which forced him to simply record the output of these systems as traditional albums rather than “sell the system itself, so that a listener would know that the music was always unique.” (Bainter, 2019).

David Cope, created systems for his own generative music compositions to inject some randomness and chance into the musical compositions he was producing and he extended it by combining musical styles that never existed before. This is one of the best parts of generative music that one can combine different genres and styles all together and effectively create a new genre, which would be quite difficult to do with complete human compositions.
