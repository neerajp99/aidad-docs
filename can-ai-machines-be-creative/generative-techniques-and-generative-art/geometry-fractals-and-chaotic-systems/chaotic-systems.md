When we go deeper and deeper into the Mandelbrot set, we will see the Mandelbrot set extending outwards and is creating this bifurcation diagram. The logistic map or the bifurcation diagram is basically a part of the Mandelbrot set and exists only on the real line because we put only real numbers into our equation. This method was the first method to generate random numbers on the computer and gave rise to a topic called Chaotic behavior. Though these are predictable in nature, a small change in the initial state would result in a very large difference in the final outcome.

As discussed earlier, we use randomization quite often when working with generative art pieces. Chaos theory concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can in principle be predicted. Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random. This means that, say we change the initial state by some margin and we assume the final output would also be just slightly different. But the reality is that the output is an outcome of deterministic chaos.

It's important to keep in mind that the dynamics of these chaotic systems are non-linear and are quite difficult to predict over time, even while the systems themselves are deterministic machines following a strict sequence of cause and effect and the results are drastically different. One thing while working with generative art is that we should not get confused with chaotic systems as random systems. Attractors are the best examples when it comes to chaotic systems, more commonly the Lorenz attractor and the de-Jong attractor.
