# Fractals

Fractals are unique and complicated mathematical forms of art. These are the neverending patterns, which means no matter how much we zoom in we will see the similar pattern over and over again on any scale. Fractals are everywhere from the snowflakes, galaxies, cloud formations, broccoli, and flowers in nature. The term fractal was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot, who worked at IBM in New York.

He was inspired by the works of mathematicians to understand the curve and experiments like a single line could be divided forever, and he noticed a strange pattern out there, and put a lot of numbers in the IBM machines, and came up with an interesting design. He found that the patterns keep on repeating again and again, and the process led him to a breakthrough equation, resulting in his own numbers and the creation of the ‘Mandelbrot’ set. For him, it was a pragmatic desire to model nature in a way that actually captures roughness such that these self-similar shapes could give a basis for modelling the regularity in some sort of roughness.

One of the most amazing facts about the Mandelbrot fractal is that the more you zoom in the newer patterns you see forming inside of it. This also led to the new era of math called the ‘Fractal geometry’, and has been used in fields like climate change, trajectories of meteoroids and more. Fractals are quite popular among programmers and generative artists, because a small set of code can produce images that are way more intricate than any human hand could ever hope to draw.

The Mandelbrot fractal is represented on a complex plane where there is a coordinate that has complex numbers.&#x20;

The X-Y axis represents the real axions and the Z-axis represents the imaginary part. We pick a number C, any number in the complex plane and start with z = 0, and then iterate the equation over and over again. If it blows up to infinity, then the number C is not part of the set, and if the number C remains finite after infinite iterations, it's a part of the Mandelbrot set.

If C is held constant and the initial value of z is variable instead, then one obtains the corresponding Julia set for each point in the parameter space of the simple function.

Inside the Mandelbrot set, there are two parts, main bulb and the main cardioid. All of the numbers in the main cardioid end up stabilising onto a single constant value but the numbers in this main bulb end up oscillating back and forth between two values, and then hit the Chaotic part. The Chaotic part happens only at the needle, where the Mandelbrot set gets very thin.
