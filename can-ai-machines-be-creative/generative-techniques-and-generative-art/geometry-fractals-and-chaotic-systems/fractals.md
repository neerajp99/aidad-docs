# Fractals

Fractals are unique and complicated mathematical forms of art. These are the neverending patterns, which means no matter how much we zoom in we will see the similar pattern over and over again on any scale. Fractals are everywhere from the snowflakes, galaxies, cloud formations, broccoli, and flowers in nature. The term fractal was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot, who worked at IBM in New York.

He was inspired by the works of mathematicians to understand the curve and experiments like a single line could be divided forever, and he noticed a strange pattern out there, and put a lot of numbers in the IBM machines, and came up with an interesting design. He found that the patterns keep on repeating again and again, and the process led him to a breakthrough equation, resulting in his own numbers and the creation of the ‘Mandelbrot’ set. For him, it was a pragmatic desire to model nature in a way that actually captures roughness such that these self-similar shapes could give a basis for modelling the regularity in some sort of roughness.
