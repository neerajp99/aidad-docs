# Effective Complexity / Control in Generative Art

In computational creativity, we can leverage the mathematics of randomness, fractals and so forth and can achieve something called Effective complexity. This means that we don’t want complete randomization as that would be just white noise, and we don’t want order because that would be too predictable. So, we want something in between and if we have a mathematical system that has enough random behavior, so as not to be completely random that could be the basis for creative artifacts.

In the book The Computational Beauty of Nature(1998), Gary Flake has talked about the effective complexity of generative art techniques, and pointed out that the regular and irregular artifacts are simple. Similarly, Philip Galanter in his paper, “What is Generative Art? Complexity Theory as a Context for Art Theory” (Galanter, 2003), described generative art systems in terms of effective complexity, where he mentioned that the art based on symmetry, tiling, and Lsystems. Flake has put forward the approach that these systems are going to be more ordered than generative art systems based on randomization, and are highly disordered with low complexity.&#x20;

Generative art systems based on evolutionary computation are found lying in between the order and disorder spectrum including the most effective complexity. But, if we accept this paradigm that generative art systems are defined by the use of systems, and that systems can best be understood in the context of complexity theory, we can lead to an unusually broad and inclusive understanding of what generative art systems really is. There are a number of underlying theories about generative art and its definition. We could somehow summarize it as: (Galanter, 2012)

1. It uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve form.
2. It uses randomisation in its composition.
3. It's constantly changing over time while on display.
4. It has been automatically creating variations of a central data.

So, we can use chance as a generator to generate different generative techniques, based on (Phon-Amnuaisuk & Panjapornpon, 2012):

1. Stochastic Processes where stochastic processes have been used to create abstract visual artifacts.
2. Grammar, where we instruct the computer what it should be developing and it simply tells the rules through which we can create new sentences and determine if a sentence is a part of the language. So, rules and grammar could be used to gain more control over the dependency and relationship among components, like the position, size, color.
3. Evolutionary Computing and Exosystemic Approach, where we use genetic algorithms and genetic computing to create abstract images.
