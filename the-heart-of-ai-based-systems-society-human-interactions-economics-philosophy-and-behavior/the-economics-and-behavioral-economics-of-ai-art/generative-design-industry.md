# Generative Design industry

Artificial Intelligence is coming of immense use in the Generative Design industry where autonomous systems and AI based Generative Design systems are generating multiple iterations of different designs in the automobile, shoe, telecommunication, aviation industry etc.

An example of such design is _Argo Concepts by designer Cam Stewart_ who manages the generative design at Adidas (Sample design in Figure below).

Overall, in effect, Al has enabled generative design solution with algorithms that help industries to produce a wide range of design alternatives in a short span of time. And it is for this reason, the generative design industry is expected to accelerate at rates of 16 percent due to an increase in AI intervention. (Technavio, 2019).

This could result to major changes in the job market. Due to increasing capability of AI based Generative Design systems, there would be a less need to have a large team of designers working towards product creation. For instance, there would be a less requirement of head designers, sub designers etc. and a lot of the idea creation can be done by these systems and mainly the work of final product design and finishing touches would be human oriented. This is in one sense capable of replacing the very high skilled jobs in the design industry (the idea creation teams) and the only requirement would be of lower skilled finalization teams. At the same time, there would be a greater demand for skilled generative designers especially with AI based expertise to design such dedicated AI based Generative systems and Generative design autonomous bodies. A similar idea has been reflected upon in a report and blog by the Autodesk team (English, 2017);

> _“AI and generative design may replace some of the need for designers, draftsmen, engineers, and so on, but our jobs will shift into new areas with as much potential as before.”_

However, it is also important to note that in the initial stages, such a product might act merely as a tool to support and assist other designers, similar to what is happening in the Healthcare industry where AI is assisting doctors rather than replacing an entire team of designers. However, this still does pose a risk of higher skilled jobs being lost.

This argument does support what ex RBI governor and economist Raghuram Rajan has often evaluated upon that AI would have the capability of “taking over both skilled and unskilled jobs” (The Economic Times, 2018). However, at the same time, the generative art hypothetical study shown above shows a risk to creative professionals as well which according to Rajan is something which would be immune to AI.

This might not be the case with AI in the generative design spectrum. However, it is likely that the industry would still require creative professionals but of different skillset than before (More AI oriented creative professional), in the long run. Furthermore, in the long run, this also poses a risk of a market restructuring, and moreover causing traditional Photoshop based designers to lose jobs similar to what happened to advertisers and designers in the past who used hand/sketch-based art and design.
