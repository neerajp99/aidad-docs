# The hidden ‘art’ of the art market

The art market is often known to be operating simultaneously in two economies - The market economy, based on cash, earnings and collectors (as discussed in the previous sections of the paper) and The gift economy, which is based on non-monetary gains such as ‘Regard’, ‘The joy of creativity’, “Hobby’, altruism and satisfaction. And art including AI based art forms a large part of the gift economy which at times remains underground and unrecognized, due to the lack of ability to quantify ‘gifts’. In the book ‘The Gift’, world renowned writer Lewis Hyde has described precisely how the gift community operates by “status, prestige or esteem, which take place of cash remuneration” (p. 101). However, this might arise a question that if status is achieved, why would people continue to achieve status and esteem?

The answer to this question lies in human behavior. Our quest for self-esteem and status is never ending. Our quest for ‘regard’ is never ending. This is the reason we see the concept of ‘gift’ across communities, and cultures. In addition, the fear of losing regard and trust might provide a “strong incentive to continue” (Offer, 1997, p. 453). Thus, the cycle of gifting continues to sustain that regard in a particular society. However, the wonder arises of how Artificial Intelligence based Art is linked to this Economy of Regard and the Gift Economy.

For the sake of explanation, it would be important to bring back the Edmond De Bellamy example. This case brought forward the number of various parties involved in the art piece- Christies, Obvious Art group and Robbie Barrat. It was Barrat’s regard for the community that he didn’t think so serious of the matter. This is a sort of ‘gift’ that Barrat lended a part of his code to Obvious Art group. Similarly, a lot of the algorithms and “the heart” of AI art works are shared across the community to cultivate further research and innovation. This has been perfectly put forward by Lewis Hyde;

> _“\[Contributions] become one to the degree that ideas move as gifts” (p. 103)_

In addition, Lewis Hyde comments on how artists' knowledge base would operate in the past.

> “Guilds of artisans such as stone masons …. would keep them know how a secret and charge a fee from the public” (p. 105).

A similar sort of mechanism is plausible in the AI art market. Within the guild of the AI art market, there could be a free circulation of ideas and algorithms as seen in the codes shared via open source licenses and GitHub of AI artists, which can be understood by like-minded community members, while charging a fee from the normal collectors and the market economy.

This is in general a sustainable model especially for the art and culture around AI art to be propagated and in one sense this sort of “Gift Economy” is further democratizing the art space. In addition, the act of gifting and “borrowing codes” is common in the field along with gifting of art pieces within the circuit as is with the non-AI art market as well. A good example and reflection of this community is how the AI art community is being brought together via organizations such _as_ [www.aiartists.org](https://www.aiartists.org)

Such Artist based communities where community members have the gift and satisfaction of being creative in essence brings about beautiful outcomes as evaluated by French Sociologist Marcel Mauss in the 1925 essay “The Gift: Forms and Functions of Exchange in Archaic Societies”, where he explains how the engine of community and the objects created lead to social, psychological, emotional and spiritual bonds as \[gifts] are passed on from one to another. And gifts of course are a very broad term in Mauss’ perspective and school of thought. In the case of AI art, it could be said that the gift is the art piece produced, the autonomous system built, the algorithms, shared resources, ideas, knowledge base etc.
