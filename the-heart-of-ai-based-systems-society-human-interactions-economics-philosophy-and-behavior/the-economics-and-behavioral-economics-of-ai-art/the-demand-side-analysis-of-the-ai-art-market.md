# The demand side analysis of the AI art market

It has been embedded into the mindset that prices of ‘hand’ made art like Picasso are capable of reaching skyrocketing prices of millions of dollars. However, it is still not considered acceptable for computer made /AI produced art to have such prices. When AI-produced portrait ‘Edmond de Belamy’ was auctioned at Christies in 2018 for a price of about $400,000, there was an immense amount of criticism because it wasn’t considered acceptable for an Artificial intelligence art piece to be sold off at such a high price. When a survey was conducted across the Ashoka University community among the undergraduate students, master’s students and certain members of the faculty and the undergraduate admissions team, the results were surprising yet expected.

When the painting ‘Edmond de Ballamy” was presented to the survey participants, there were a large number who did not think it was worth the price (See Graph Below).

And when the participants were told that the painting was made by _Artificial Intelligence and via a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)_, **people’s perceptions changed even further and those who had responded as the painting being worth the price, changed their opinion as not being worth the price** (See Graph Below).

To further ascertain these arguments, there were a couple of other questions asked to prove the audience’s general perception of AI based Art. Another question posed to the survey respondents was two sets of paintings - one set with the AI art and another made by normal traditional artists. As a control, both the sets shown were kept to be of a similar aesthetic measure and design (Both the sets were portraits with the AI portraits being influenced by the handmade portrait artist).

As shown in the graph below, more observers tended to vote for Set B (made by Artists). There was a general inclination of the audience towards Artist produced paintings.

Before the above scenarios were posed, all the participants were shown the same set of paintings all together without being told whether the paintings were produced by AI or an artist and in that regard, a broad inclination towards AI produced and Artist produced paintings can be seen. This is because the participants were unaware who and what made the painting or art piece.

As seen in diagram below, there isn’t a wide divergence between AI art and Artist produced art. This is partially because the survey respondents did not know which is which.

However, once the questions are posed in terms of AI vs Artist produced art, the inclination and biases towards Artist produced artworks can be noticed. A couple of other similar set of questions were posed in the survey to ascertain the trend and a similar trend tended to follow with more people inclined towards Artist produced art rather than AI based Art.

Towards the end of the survey, an AI produced art piece was displayed with the ‘Artificial Intelligence tag’ on it and the survey participants were asked to rate the work and there was a wide range of responses, as shown in Figure below.

There is indeed a mixed opinion here but most of the survey respondents voted in the middle range.

One major conclusion drawn out of the survey is that humans tend to prefer human produced art works, even though with a similar aesthetic quality This could be because human beings can associate with the artists background through the art works and also can understand the emotions behind the art piece, a characteristic and feeling that ceases to exist in AI based art as people and viewers begin to look at the art work in a more mechanical manner and thus, stop associating with it. This is again something resulting from the perception of the mind and how we see art in general. As the audience, we would rather find it ‘ugly’ (Hoek, Interview, August 5 2020), to have a painting like Edmond de Bellamy produced by AI but might look at it in a different way if the same painting was produced by human beings.

This is something that the mind has been made to believe over the years. It has become the part of how we structure our seeing. In John Berger’s Book The Ways of Seeing (1972), Berger has presented the idea as a product of capitalism and what is considered to be a standard of the way we are seeing (p. 154);

> _“Capitalism survives by forcing the majority, whom it exploits, to define their own interests as narrowly as possible. This was once achieved by extensive deprivation. Today in the developed countries it is being achieved by imposing a false standard of what is and what is not desirable.”_

In a similar context, the standards of seeing art today has been defined by the way we have seen art over the years - on canvas, with paint, or camera, and with the same palette of colors. These are things commonly available in the Art market, produced out of capitalistic gains as art produced by Picasso would appreciate in value.

But art produced by AI is still not likely to appreciate in terms of monetary value. The general viewer is resistant to change this standard as this is what has become comfortable and become recognizable to the eye. We can recognize Picasso style of art but find it difficult to recognize AI based art and thus it is something that is rejected by the mind. In turn, explaining the inclination towards the ‘Artist’ tag rather than the AI ‘tag’ in the survey.

The overall drive towards Artist made paintings, is also because of the general perception that art once reproduced by machinery is of a lower value than art produced by hand. This idea has been framed by philosophers and media critics like Walter Benjamin that “A product of mechanical reproduction may not touch the actual work of art, yet the quality is always depreciated” in The Work of Art in the age of mechanical reproduction (1969, p. 2).

This is not necessarily appropriate for art made via AI or autonomous systems because there is a sense of originality that comes from the AI artist and programmer that is reflected upon in the works. The medium is different but the art is original, because if the art is not original, AI artists would not be able to survive in the art world. They are surviving but their names are still relatively unknown to the non-AI art world. One of the major reasons behind such a phenomenon, according to AI Artist Tyler Hobbs is the “Lack of technical knowledge behind the AI art pieces in the market”. For this reason, Tyler Hobbs ensures that with every art piece, the ‘code’ is sent along with the piece, for people and the collectors to understand what has gone into the making of the art piece.
