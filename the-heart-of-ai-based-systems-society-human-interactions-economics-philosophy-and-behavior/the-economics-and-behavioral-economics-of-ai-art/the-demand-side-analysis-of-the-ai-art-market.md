# The demand side analysis of the AI art market

It has been embedded into the mindset that prices of ‘hand’ made art like Picasso are capable of reaching skyrocketing prices of millions of dollars. However, it is still not considered acceptable for computer made /AI produced art to have such prices. When AI-produced portrait ‘Edmond de Belamy’ was auctioned at Christies in 2018 for a price of about $400,000, there was an immense amount of criticism because it wasn’t considered acceptable for an Artificial intelligence art piece to be sold off at such a high price. When a survey was conducted across the Ashoka University community among the undergraduate students, master’s students and certain members of the faculty and the undergraduate admissions team, the results were surprising yet expected.

When the painting ‘Edmond de Ballamy” was presented to the survey participants, there were a large number who did not think it was worth the price (See Graph Below).

And when the participants were told that the painting was made by _Artificial Intelligence and via a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)_, **people’s perceptions changed even further and those who had responded as the painting being worth the price, changed their opinion as not being worth the price** (See Graph Below).

To further ascertain these arguments, there were a couple of other questions asked to prove the audience’s general perception of AI based Art. Another question posed to the survey respondents was two sets of paintings - one set with the AI art and another made by normal traditional artists. As a control, both the sets shown were kept to be of a similar aesthetic measure and design (Both the sets were portraits with the AI portraits being influenced by the handmade portrait artist).

As shown in the graph below, more observers tended to vote for Set B (made by Artists). There was a general inclination of the audience towards Artist produced paintings.
