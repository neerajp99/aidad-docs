# The problem of profit division in AI Art

As per AI Artist Memo Akten, these are ways of creating AI Art: (Sterling, 2019)

1. Train on your own data with your own (or heavily modified) algorithms
2. Train on your own data with off-the-shelf (or lightly modified) algorithms (e.g. Anna Ridler, Helena Sarin)
3. Curate your own data and use your own (or heavily modified) algorithms (e.g. Mario Klingemann, Georgia Ward Dyer)
4. Curate your own data and use off-the-shelf (or lightly modified) algorithms
5. Use existing datasets and train with heavily modified algorithms
6. Use existing datasets and train with off-the-shelf (or lightly modified) algorithms (this is what Obvious has done).

Thus, due to the complexity of ways AI art can be made, it becomes a difficult and cumbersome process to divide accounting profits among the parties involved in the creation of the art piece, especially when an art piece is sold at an auction at a high price as determining the extent of involvement of each of the parties is difficult. The coder of the dataset, the coder of ‘off the shelf algorithms’ etc. in this case are being referred to as the different parties involved in the making of an AI art piece. Therefore, leading to a conflict amongst different parties.

Such instances could mirror with the profit and revenue division issues that occur in partnership-based companies and companies that have multiple shareholders. In this case, the shareholders could be said to be the multiple people involved when an open source algorithm is used. Though it is open source, it seems unethical to not give enough monetary credit to the creator. However, it is increasingly becoming accepted in the market as a community sharing strategy - more as a reason to innovate and propagate the AI art culture rather than base it on monetary divisions. (As discussed in the [Gift Economy](the-hidden-art-of-the-art-market.md) section).
