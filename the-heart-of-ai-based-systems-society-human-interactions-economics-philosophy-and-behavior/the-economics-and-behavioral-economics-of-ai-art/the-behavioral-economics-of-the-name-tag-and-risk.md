# The behavioral economics of the ‘Name Tag’ and “Risk”

Art buyers like all consumers tend to be irrational in several ways when determining their purchase. Human beings tend to account various factors when purchasing or doing a particular job often not out of rationality but out of irrationality. For instance, a traditional economist might claim that volunteering is not sustainable because there is no monetary gain in exchange of the work done but still millions of people volunteer each year, because of the altruistic gain they get by doing the work. There is sort of satisfaction they receive by doing the volunteer work. Similarly, companies present flavors and tastes on the front of food packaging and the health hazards on the side, in order to nudge buyers towards making a particular choice (Cummings, 2018).

In a similar way, the operation of the art market today can be explained by the principle of irrationality. There are several factors that go into a purchase of an art piece: The mere-exposure principle, The signaling function, The Bandwagon Effect, and The Snob effect. The traditional art market already has an established name among art collectors with regular auctions being held at Sotheby’s and Christies with art pieces fetching up to millions of dollars.&#x20;

This market has a well-known name and is considered a ‘safer’ investment to make. Such a market is characterized by the Mere Exposure Principle because its establishment is made by the exposure to such a market over the years. There are more people who would have heard of traditional abstract artists or contemporary artists or muralists compared to AI artists. Also, this could be explained by perhaps the smaller population of AI artists that exist today compared to the number of traditional artists in the art market.

Another reason for a lower dominance of AI art in the art market is because of the lack of socially linked trademarks in the AI art field. AI art is not linked with social status or identity as much as how traditional art works are. By traditional, we mean ‘non-AI’ artworks. For instance, owning an artwork by M.F Hussain or a Padma Shri artist Jatin Das comes with the opportunity to create flaunt the names of the artist in the social circle, a bit like how owning a Mercedes or a BMW is considered to be a symbol of someone’s social status. This is something which behavioral economists would classify as “The Signalling function” - “Trademarks and names establish Social Identity”. The trademark and ‘name’ around AI art is still limited.

And with the trademark of “The name of the artist” around non-AI art creates a situation of more people chasing the same ‘good’ or art piece, also known as the ‘Bandwagon’ Principle. With more people chasing the same art piece, there would also be a general increase in the demand for the product or similar products. Thus, often leading to a copy and forfeits market of art. However, such a phenomenon is still rare in the AI art market as the market is relatively smaller.

A principle that fits perfectly with the AI art market is the “Snob effect”. The snob effect derives out of the desire to be unique and different and along with being different comes the ‘risk’ of being different. According to AI artist Mario Klingemann, the AI art market is more based on risk taking collectors, in turn making the AI art market more niche in nature. This is another reason why most of the AI art collectors tend to be of a younger age bracket and often belong to technical backgrounds, as per our market research and interviews with AI Artists.

Moreover, reports and research by Artwork archive, show that “Millennial collectors, on the other hand, are more likely to take risks, go above and beyond when it comes to networking in the industry and use social media to buy art” (Who Is Buying Art Right Now?, 2017).

However, the number of risk takers in the art market is still low.

The art market currently largely comprises a middle and older age group with several following a family tradition of collecting art as per a market survey conducted by Axa Art(2014).&#x20;

The pie chart below shows the age bracket distribution of most of the art collectors.

![Age Bracket Distribution of Art Collectors](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-01-05 at 5.38.52 PM (1).png>)

As per the above figure, most of the art collectors are above 40 years and “are passionate about art” (Axa, p. 12), or “are continuing a family tradition” (Axa, p. 12), or are “investors” or lastly are hybrid collectors collecting for various of the above-mentioned reasons. This shows the sort of Bandwagon effect taking place in the art market. Such art buyers are less likely to take risk and invest into AI based Art and it is for this reason that AI art market is not running in as dynamic way as it was expected to be except for the AI oriented and AI fascinated and risk-taking collectors who are willing to change their perceptions which tends to be smaller proportion of these collectors.

However, to shed some positive light on to the matter, in the long run the AI art market could be one with an increased exposure(The mere exposure principle) with a known social status(The signalling function) and multiple factors accounting for a general attraction towards AI art such as an increased education and knowledge around AI and its operations and increased exposure at art exhibitions and fairs and auctions (signs which we are already seeing in the art market at present with works like Edmond de Belamy and the AIDA robot produced art piece, among many others).

At the same time, the AI art market is at risk of losing out on exclusivity, in case it becomes an increasingly common skill. In the present day, this is a skill that is being performed by a small set of AI artists. In the long run, as more and more AI artists evolve, there would be an increasing number of codes and algorithms available on open source platforms online. This is already happening. For instance, The AI art piece Edmond De Belamy by Obvious Art group is said to have been based on AI artist and Programmer Robbie Barrat’s code which he published on an open source platform and license. (Vincent, 2018). AI artist Mario Klingemann in an interview with The Verge has explained that “90 percent of the work was done by \[Barrat]” (Vincent, 2018).

However, enough credit has not been given to Barrat. When the painting is searched for on Google, most of the articles emphasize on the Obvious Art group without even mentioning Barrat’s code or giving the young 19-year-old programmer enough credit. This is happening in the present-day scenario where the population of popular AI artists and AI skilled people are still low. In the long run, if this population increases, the art market is at risk of having multiple similar looking paintings without even knowing the source of the painting or design as is happening with application design templates or automated Poster making platforms. This might pose a serious threat and risk to the market and in addition also leading the AI art market to collapse in one sense as people would no longer trust the value of AI art because of the lack of exclusivity in the market.

If the AI art market takes such a path, then it is under threat of becoming like the Graphic design and advertising industry in the past with a lot more production of AI art but of a lower monetary value. There are several graphic designers in the recent past who have expressed that they are “disposable, under-appreciated, underpaid and overworked” (Graphic Designer for 14 Years and I Can’t Stand It Anymore!! Please Help., 2020).

This is similar to what has happened to Robbie Barrat with AI art- he has been underappreciated and there is very little information available on whether he was paid a fair share of the auction. When Barrat was interviewed on the matter by The Verge he did explain that he has given Obvious Art group authorization to take a part of the code but apparently, they had taken a large chunk of the code that he published on GitHub.

But what Barrat is more worried about is that such instances could spoil the impression of the AI art market and also deprive the “actual AI artists of their deserved spotlight” (Vincent, 2018).

But what Barrat is more worried about is that such instances could spoil the impression of the AI art market and also deprive the “actual AI artists of their deserved spotlight” (Vincent, 2018).

In case this sort of thing does happen in the near future, then AI art is at risk of becoming a new quick automated ‘Photoshop’ with a lack of uniqueness in the art pieces. And this is scary and something AI artists need to be responsible about and take appropriate care in the designing their algorithms for the market and the users of the market to maintain a sense of integrity.

Furthermore, if the AI art market does become similar to the graphic design industry, there is a further risk of losing the market to traditional arts.

This would in effect make traditional arts more of a luxury good while making AI based art more of a commonly available good. This could be compared to how luxury watch brands like Rolex prices have increased over the years. First of all, by increasing the prices, they are making the watch more of a ‘Veblen Good” where a higher price signals better quality and thus a higher quantity demand, also pushing Rolex further deeper into the luxury watch market. And in turn, they are also setting it aside from cheaper more affordable brands, making use of the SIgnalling Function and the Snob effect, - two aspects of behavioral consumption evaluated earlier in the paper.

By owning a ‘Rolex’, the owner is trying to gain a “recognized status symbol” (Bredan, 2015), and are desiring to be unique. A similar aspect might happen with the art market as well. If there is an ample amount of AI art in the market, collectors might be even more driven to traditional non-AI arts because of its uniqueness and value attached to it, making non-AI arts more like the ‘Rolex’ of the market, swamped by cheaper more affordable watch companies (metaphorically meaning AI art).

However, in the market survey conducted in the past month with AI artists (Interviews with AI artists, July-August 2020), most AI artists seem to be not very worried about this aspect as most of the AI artists we interviewed believe that as the community becomes larger, so will the capabilities to produce better art and the ‘better’ would stand out. As Generative Artist Matt Deslauriers has put forward in our email interview “I’m not too worried…. Good programmers are still scarce...” and thus he believes that this might be an eventuality but nothing to worry about at the present stage, where AI art stands with a limited exposure and a limited population of practitioners.

At the same time, AI artist Mario Klingemann approached the entire matter of the art industry differently. For him, it is less about the market but more a matter of human psychology. In continuation to our email discussion with Mario Klingemann, Klingemann explained that the number of celebrity artists are going to decrease anyways in the near future because of the ‘mass’ in the market. It is only in human psychology that people want a “few of these artists around’ (Mail Interview, July 26, 2020). This change in perceptions around artists and celebrities might change the way we look at all forms of art and how we perceive AI and non-AI art.
