# The risk to cultural heritage

In order to understand the risk art produced from AI poses, it is important to understand the purpose behind the original handmade paintings in the first place. Tanjore Art was produced during the Chola Dynasty in the 16th Century, a time when the Nayakas (Army leaders) encouraged art and innovation in art forms especially around the fields of classical dance, music, literature and paintings on the themes of traditional heritage temples (Mathur, 2020). This overall spree of innovation and creativity during the time led to the development of the Tanjore (named after the city of Thanjavur in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu).

Another reason for this innovation was due to artists from other states beginning to migrate to Thanjavur, in order to work under the Nayakas since arts were being encouraged. All of these aspects put together created the art form Tanjore.

On the other hand, the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo Da Vinci is a sketch that tries to “depict an idealized nude male” (Abdou, 2018). In particular, the measurements of an ideal body have been mathematically calculated and placed in correlation to the Vitruvian Man.

By putting together, the two periods via Artificial Intelligence, there is a risk of losing both the traditions. As Art Historian E.H. Gombrich has noted that often old art forms like the art and architecture in the Mesopotamia civilization were not made to “decorate” the area but rather to ensure that the “image of the mighty is kept alive'' (p. 70). By juxtaposing different art forms via large data sets, there is a risk of losing the authenticity and relevance of the original data as the data is only relevant to that time and period, and irrelevant if mixed. In addition, a painting like the one produced by mixing Tanjore and the Vitruvian man, though innovative, could lead to sending out a wrong incorrect message to the viewer which could negatively affect the history of the periods those paintings belong to.

However, making new paintings using Artificial Intelligence without actually picking up arts from periods of the past and developing new periods altogether without harming the tradition is what could be said to be the ethical usage of Artificial intelligence in the art industry.&#x20;

Artists like Tyler Hobbs have been developing arts on the basis of Geographical lines and ship maps like the Art work ‘Side Effects’ (relevance to Geographical images and fault lines), which could be said to be an innovative way of experimenting with the arts without causing harm to anyone and creating new appeal across the viewers of art.)
