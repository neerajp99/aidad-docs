# History of Computational Art democratization

The goal of democratizing art is believed to have come in to discussion since the beginning of computational art and one of the core techniques to the democratization was to improve the aesthetics mathematically using Birkhoff’s Aesthetic equation (as shown below) and thereby increase the reproducibility by improving the Aesthetic value - an idea that was proposed by one of the earliest computer graphic designer and generative artist - Frieder Nake.

> _M = O/C, where M is the Aesthetic Measure, O is the Order and C is the complexity._

Thus, in order to improve the measure, the order must be increased and complexity decreased, which was contradictory to most of the art that existed as by subjecting some of the world’s most abstract works to the equation, there would be surprisingly low aesthetic measures. However, Nake and other scientists at the Stuttgart Experiments were aiming to improve the information aesthetics without necessarily reducing the meaning of the art piece in itself. Also, another goal to increase the aesthetic measure was to reduce the harsh criticism around artworks during those days and making it more mathematically precise. The main aim behind this was that by increasing the order and lowering the complexity the price of art could be significantly reduced - enabling mass production of art.

And similarly, this idea appears in AI art as well - _“That might be an inevitability of AI art: Wide swaths of art-historical context are abstracted into general, visual patterns.”_ (Bogust, 2019). Thus, when an AI art piece is sub segmented into smaller pieces a sense of simplicity is visible that enables a wider production of the art.
