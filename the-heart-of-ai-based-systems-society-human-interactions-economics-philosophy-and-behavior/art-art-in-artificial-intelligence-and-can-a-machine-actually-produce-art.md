# Art, Art in Artificial Intelligence and can a machine actually produce art?

Art is a term which has had very complex definitions. There are people who argue only something that is joyful to the eye has the capability of being called art or perhaps the objects around us are all forms of art - right from the innovation of a laptop to the clothes we are wearing, are all ultimately outputs of an artist’s imagination and cultivated from their individual creativity.

This is something the period of Dadaism in 1916 was arguing for. Even toilet seats and pots were being classified as pieces of art. On one hand several critics of art define art as a “journey we take” (Tjeerd Hoek, Email Communication, August 5, 2020), and its true essence lies in the act of doing. While others would argue that art is everything. And in a counter argument to that, there is a belief that anything that is termed to be ‘art’ is believed to be Art. This is because we start viewing and accepting that piece to be an art piece as soon as the mind is told that this is termed as ‘Art’ - something that Art historian E.H. Gombrich would classify as “Art with a capital ‘A’.” This is the psychological aspect of the way we believe (The Story of Art, 1995).

Professor Gilbert from Harvard University has explained this belief mechanism in his paper “How Mental Systems believe”. He has often described and evaluated how people find it easy to believe but difficult to doubt (1991), and how this belief mechanism has been embedded into the mind over the years. For instance, to practically understand this concept, we would like to correlate his thesis question with the works of Picasso. Picasso’s paintings are simple, in our perspective. They are mostly childlike and his strokes are naive. And Picasso has often accepted this opinion and has used it as a quality worth appreciating. Today, Picasso’s paintings are one of the most expensive pieces of art in the world with prices rising up to 179 million US dollars in the Christie’s 2015 auction. There is a sense of belief used in selling such paintings. Firstly, we have been made to believe that his art is beautiful and appealing. Secondly, Picasso is a legendary artist. The name of the artist says it all. As Art historian E.H. Gombrich (The Story of Art, p.5) has put forward, “There is no such thing as Art. There are only artists”. Thirdly and most importantly, we have been made to believe that such high prices for art is acceptable. I feel it is less to do about demand and supply for the painting but more to do about the ‘name tag’ which surrounds the painting. This is something that we shall explore deeper in the context of the [AI - Art economy](the-economics-and-behavioral-economics-of-ai-art/) later in the paper.

However, in the case of Art produced by Artificial intelligence, this belief does not exist especially for people who don’t understand or have not been made to acknowledge the insides of AI Art - the coding, the algorithm and the deep neural networks that have been involved in the creation of AI based Art. Thus, we cannot ‘believe’ that AI art can be auctioned at a high price of approx. 400,000 US Dollars (Christie’s 2018) and ‘Robotic Art at $1 million in 2019’ (Ludel). It is not considered acceptable for art produced by computers to be sold off at such high prices. Thus, raising significant criticisms from Artists, Art critics, Art historians and traditional collectors. This is essentially because the hierarchy of power, and cycle is at stake with Artificial intelligence produced creative content. For instance, the question of who gets to use AI, how to prevent misuse and ethics, and the shift of power between who has access to AI vs who doesn’t have access to AI. Or to be more precise, who has a greater capability of creating Artificial Intelligence systems for Art and Design vs who doesn’t is a concerning question for several people in not only the art field but across several fields.

Once these algorithms have been trained on a certain dataset, the system can begin to see anonymously. This is what AI Artist and Photographer Trevor Paglen has often questioned “What does it mean that ‘seeing’ no longer requires a human ‘see’er in the loop?”. The computer can begin to think beyond imagination and also of creating the unknown and unfamiliar, unlike humans and human artists who are at times bound by creative blocks and limited imagination often resulting from the surrounding environment we are in like the people we meet, the places we visit which are all limited. However, AI art can operate at times beyond limits because it is not restricted by geography or human interactions.

This is how the power dynamics begin to change. AI has the capability of becoming stronger than human beings. Artists who have the capability of harnessing this power of Artificial Intelligence, have data on art, and processes, are likely to have a stronger power to harness this world. This is similar to how nations with coal and oil began to gain strength and become global powers. (Schaare 2018). Similarly, countries and the creative population with greatest access to resources, data on art and periods and skills are likely to have the greatest power in the future and this could pose threat to the traditional forms of art. Cultural heritage might be lost in this process of development but at the same time the culture could be harnessed and exposed at a greater level with Artificial intelligence if the AI were trained on these data sets in an ethical way.

However, excessive exposure might lead to the loss of the tradition in itself as more and more people would be driven to AI based Art. For instance, if there is AI art influenced by Tanjore Art (1600s to 1800s South Indian Art), there are several possibilities built out of AI deep neural networks which produce similar paintings of the time and also bring different periods together. This has been done by certain freelance artists who have mixed Tanjore and the Vitruvian man together to bring about a new form.

As people are driven more to such forms of art, the viewership of traditional art forms covering themes of local religion and culture might decrease in the long run.
